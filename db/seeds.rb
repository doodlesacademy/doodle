  description: "Student artists learn to recognize shapes and types of line as they design and draw their own superheroes.  They begin by creating a book that tells the backstory of their superhero using their choice of drawing/writing/or a combination. They then move on to isolating graphic images into basic curved lines and using a handout to copy disparate parts of a superhero into their own unique character. They create this silhouette onto their final paper which will become the cover to their book. They learn about how costumes and details are another way of telling parts of the story, and they add to their superhero. They finish by completing their superheroes with pan watercolors.",
