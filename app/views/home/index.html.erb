      <h2>The Doodles Difference</h2>
      <p>
        Doodles Academy provides an online curriculum that includes video examples, lesson plans, supply lists, and links to Common Core and Visual Art standards.  We make it easy for educators of all types and experience levels to bring a comprehensive and open-ended curriculum to their students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our projects allow room for every child to tell her own story.  We provide lessons that scaffold skills and ideas, challenging students to think complexly, but chunking it down so that they don't become overwhelmed.  Discussion and exploration is built into each project, encouraging students to find their own creative solutions.
