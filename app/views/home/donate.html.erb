        <p>“I am a second grade teacher at a low SES school in Reno, Nevada. [...] I see a huge connection with kids who are struggling at home to meet their basic needs and art. When given the opportunity to express themselves through art they are able to communicate their pain, their dreams, their desires and their hopes. It is like magic.“</p>
