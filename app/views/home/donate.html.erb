        <h3>Large Reach</h3>
        <p>Through our virtual distribution, we are able to reach more students in more locations, while keeping operational costs down.</p>
        <p>For every $1.07 you donate, we are able to bring art to an entire class of students.<a href="#footnote-star-2">&ast;&ast;</a></p>
        <p>We work towards closing the opportunity gap by making sure that our curriculum is easy to implement whether or not educators have a background in the arts.</p>

        <h3>Consider a Small, Monthly, Sustaining Donation</h3>
        <p>If you find value in what we do, please consider making a recurring monthly donation of your choosing. It takes us hundreds of hours a month to research, compose, and market our content, and thousands of dollars a year to sustain. Your support, in any amount, really matters.</p>
        <p>Hereâ€™s how:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h4>It provides predictable revenue.</h4>
            <p><i>Monthly giving helps us avoid peaks and valleys of revenue, ensuring we can spend less time on fundraising and more time on strategic planning, marketing, lesson development, outreach, and teacher training.</i></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Simply put, it sustains our work.</h4>
            <p><i>Sustaining Patrons support the day-to-day work of Doodles Academy and demonstrate an ongoing commitment to our mission.</i></p>
