      <div class="overview">
        <p>Our Curriculum Sets are carefully curated selections of elementary school-aged visual art projects. Each Curriculum Set includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>downloadable lesson plans</li>
          <li>a scope &amp; sequence</li>
          <li>objectives</li>
          <li>vocabulary</li>
          <li>assessments</li>
          <li>learning extensions</li>
          <li>links to professional development pages</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our Curriculum Sets are more than just an art curriculum. Every lesson encourages critical thinking, speaking, and listening skills. Students develop habits of mind that they can apply to their art, their school workâ€¦and to their life. These sets are meticulously planned, easy to implement, aligned to college-and-career ready standards, as well as to the National Core Visual Art Standards, and require no training to implement.</p>

      <p>"Thanks to Doodles I was able to experience what it takes to bring students from conception to completion of a high quality art project. And it wasn't just the kids who typically love art that felt successful; all my students loved the work they produced!"</p>
