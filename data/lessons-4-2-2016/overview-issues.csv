Lower,Superheroes,1,Creating a Backstory,"In this lesson, student artists are introduced to the basic characteristics of superheroes, as well as understanding that each superhero had his or her own unique backstory that told who they were, where they came from, and why or how they became a superhero. Student artists are tasked to brainstorm their own superhero and to generate a backstory for said character by creating a small book and using any combination of writing and drawing to document their superhero’s history. They leave the cover blank for the upcoming lessons. ",SWBAT use multi-media to create and illustrate a narrative that explains their superhero’s backstory. ,"Students will be working individually and choosing their own materials, so have materials set up in a way that is easy to pass out as well as easy for the students artists to see and select from.

Apollo was a Greek Mythological God most closely associated with the sun, but also recognized as a god of music, truth and prophecy. This painting closely illustrates lines spoken in a play written about Apollo. ","If a student is having a hard time coming up with a superhero, ask them if they have heard of Superman? Tell them that he has what is called an ‘alter ego’, where most people think he is ordinary, but when he gets in his costume he has all sorts of powers. Ask them what sorts of powers they would want if they had an alter ego? Then guide them to design their alter ego. Alternately, have them think of their favorite book character and design a character based on that. ","Encourage students to add additional pages and continue to create a narrative for their superhero. Suggest different types of media; if they drew a comic, suggest writing, or creating a list with drawn icons. Students will continue to work on these books throughout the project. You can also offer students the opportunity to look through old comics, or the optional ‘5 Minute Marvel’ stories. "

Lower,Superheroes,2,Drawing a Silhouette,"In this project, artists look at the shapes that make up their own bodies and recreate these shapes on a piece of paper, cut them, re-assemble them, and ‘pose’ them in their desired superhero pose before drawing the silhouette of their superhero on their paper (this will become the cover for their book). ","SWBAT identify what shapes make up the human body.

","
Students, especially younger students, may have a difficult time cutting. If they are cutting inaccurately, encourage them to cut in smaller ‘bites’. Emphasize going around the outside of the line rather than on the inside. Tell them that it doesn’t matter if it is 100% perfect, as they are going to draw it later and they fix it up as they draw it. 
If they accidentally cut too much, tell them that they can piece it back together and just trace around the outside. If they are still upset, give them a small piece of tape to fix it with. 
If they cut the torso out as individual pieces, that’s ok.
If they misplace a body part, have them borrow a friends after that friend has traced it. 
","Early finishers can add to their ‘zine from Lesson 1, or they can add a background to their superhero silhouette, helping to tell where their superhero lives, etc. (remind them to not add details to their superhero, yet!). They can also reference the optional 5 Minute Marvel stories or old comics.  "
Upper,Superheroes,2,Drawing a Silhouette,"In this lesson, artists receive a packet of superhero ‘body parts’ that they put together and redraw to create their own, unique superhero. They draw this silhouette of their superhero on paper that will become the cover for their book. ","SWBAT isolate and copy lines in a linear image.  
SWBAT put together various images to make a unique character. ","Students will be working individually, so have materials prepared to go out to tables/desks depending on how your class is set up. Students can share scissors.

Paper collage, charcoal, and paint on canvas, 85.09x 210.19cm. ","Students may become frustrated if their drawing doesn’t look ‘right’. Ensure them that part of being an artist is identifying the things that don’t look quite right and simply fixing them. Ask them to compare the lines and the shapes and try to help them problem-solve where they feel their drawing isn’t working. Don’t point out problem areas yourself—let them come to their own conclusions. Remind them to use their papers to isolate the other parts of the image and see the lines more clearly. If they are still feeling frustrated, pair them with another  student who is managing well.
Some student might want to draw their superheroes without using the templates. Don’t force the issue—it is more important that they stay engaged. However, explain to them that it is important that they learn to look at a line and be able to make that same line on their own paper because they are creating the skills that they will need to draw from photographs and also from life. Challenge them to draw at least one feature from the packet—one arm, or the legs, etc. 
Some kids will begin adding details. Remind them that we are only drawing the silhouette because we want a strong foundation for the details. Tell them that they can work with details inside their zine if they are feeling inspired. ","Early finishers can add to their ‘zine from lesson 1. Alternately, they can look at the Optional ‘5 Minute Marvel’ stories, or through old comics. "
Lower,Superheroes,3,Adding Details,"In this lesson, students look at how artists help to define their character through the details in their characters' costume. They then create their own details that reflect the backstory that they made up in lesson 1.

It is important that students are looking at their drawing from lesson two and altering and editing it. Some students may want to start over, but encourage them to work with what they have, adding or erasing parts of it until it works for them. This is to teach students to adapt and think creatively about the problem in front of them.

Bring in a variety of objects. These can be everyday objects you have around the house, such as cups and stuffed animals and plants.

If they paint is too dark, they won’t be able to get the wash effect. The paint should be light, and the marker used for the areas they want to be dark.  
Remind students to use a lot of water when making washes to gradually buildup color—particularly with the first layer, student artists may make it too dark. They can even paint with water first, then add paint to the water to create a very light layer.  
It is o.k. if they use more than one color as their first wash as long as they have a plan and reason. (For example, if one half of the page is day and one is night, or one portion is in sunlight and one is in darkness). ","Before a student finishes, ask them to cover all the white areas with color.

Alternatively, they can turn their color into a wash using water and a brush and minimize the effect a little bit.
