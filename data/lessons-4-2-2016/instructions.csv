The teacher should show lots of excitement and listen to the stories the students are coming up with. Periodically stop the class and have artists share the backstory of their superhero to get increased engagement. At this point, don’t worry about students refining their work—the focus is on getting the artists invested in their character. However, try to encourage them to come up with concrete details (what their superhero does, who they fight, what their name is, why they are a superhero, etc.) rather than simply drawing.

Clean-up times will vary with materials; get to know your class and allow 5-10 minutes depending on how efficient they are and whether or not the material was messy. 

Choose presenting student artists in advance and let them know during their work time so that they are prepared. Sharing should work as follows:
Student stands in by their work. A teacher should hold it, or place it on an easel. 

The student presents their work, answering What they made, How they made it, and Why they made the decisions that they did. When they are done they ask “Any comments or questions?” and can take responses from the audience. 

A note on responses: it is o.k. if a audience member questions or wants clarification from the artist. It is also o.k. if an audience member makes suggestions. But it must be done in a kind, thoughtful, and respectful way. 
Always end the conversation by asking the class to give the artist a compliment. "

Students should be intentionally using colors to describe where their house is located—in a warm or cool environment.  At the beginning of class focus conversation on how the student’s environment feels—whether it feel rainy, or dry, etc. 
Students will first finish their watercolor, allow it to dry,then work back into it. Students will have this lesson and next to finish it, so there is no rush.

 Drying stations can be set up with blow dryers to speed the process along. Alternatively, students who finish painting can work on the ‘early finishers’ assignment while they wait for their painting to dry. 

While students are painting, remind them not to overpaint, as they’ll be going back into it with different media. The idea is to get color across the whole page and to map out the basic areas, starting with the lightest color in the color family and moving to the darkest. 

Once students move on to different media, comment on the different ways that students are combining media. Be specific in your comments (interesting how you are letting the marker show through the oil pastel to create that texture, the painted sky makes a nice contrast to the very defined markered building, etc.)"

For example, if students are setting up their own still life, show them that they will be choosing some objects (tell them how), & placing them on the table in front of them, then drawing them by finding the different shapes within.

Upper,A Toy’s Story,4,Marker Techniques,Worktime,FOCUS ON MINDFULLY WORKING. ,,"Before students begin working, they should have a plan for what they want to do; they want to be slow and deliberate as they are putting down color. 

Remind students not to overpaint—they should be allowing each layer to dry before adding the next. Conversation should be on student working intentionally and carefully building up layers, ending with the markers. 

Students will finish the first layer of their watercolor, allow it to dry,then work back into it. Students will have this lesson and next to finish it, so there is no rush. Drying stations can be set up with blow-dryers to speed the process along. Alternatively, students can work on the ‘early finishers’ assignment while they wait for their painting to dry. "

",5-10M,"Depending on the teacher’s style of classroom management, it might be helpful to only choose and train a few kids to clean. The reset of the class can be busy with the presentation. Make sure to train these helpers well in advance so that you aren’t left with a messy room. 

Clean-up times will vary with materials; get to know your class and allow 5-10 minutes depending on how efficient they are and whether or not the material was messy. 

Choose presenting student artists in advance and let them know during their work time so that they are prepared. Sharing should work as follows:
Student stands in by their work. A teacher should hold it, or place it on an easel. 
The student presents their work, answering What they made, How they made it, and Why they made the decisions that they did. When they are done they ask “Any comments or questions?” and can take responses from the audience. 
A note on responses: it is o.k. if a audience member questions or wants clarification from the artist. It is also o.k. if an audience member makes suggestions. But it must be done in a kind, thoughtful, and respectful way. 
Always end the conversation by asking the class to give the artist a compliment. "

Show them the example of ‘finished/unfinished’ work. Ask them to point out the differences. 
Explain to them that when they are finished, they are going to reflect on their work. Explain that part of becoming a better artist is to learn from each artwork. So they are going to celebrate what they did well, but also notice what could be approved upon. Show them the reflection sheet and explain that they will write two stars—or, two things that they like or think they did well with their piece, and one wish—one thing they would change or do differently if they were to redo their piece.

Lower,A Toy’s Story,5,Finishing,Worktime,FOCUS ON TECHNIQUE AND CAREFUL AND THOUGHTFUL COLORING,,"Students should first outline their drawing with black sharpie (sharpie to keep the lines from bleeding). This will give them clear sections to fill in. After it is outlined, they can choose how to fill in each section, but comment on student artists doing so carefully and thoughtfully rather than scribbling; using the black lines as boundaries between different sections and using different colors or patterns to differentiate. 

Also comment on the variety of patterns or colors being used by students."

Explain to them that when they are finished, they can begin working on an artist statement. An artist statement is something that an artist writes that can tell his or her viewer important information about his or her artwork if he or she is not there to explain it in person. Show them the artist statement sheet and give them an example. "

Ask them about the decisions that they are making to make them aware of focused artistic decisions; i.e, “Why did you decide to use a short, diagonal line pattern?” or “I’m noticing your color choices! How did you decide on them?” Keep the observations neutral and let the artists take it from there. "
